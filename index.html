      <h1 id= "mainHeading">My Experience Growing Up In Public Schools</h1>
      <p>Posted by Lauren Wright</p>
      <p>Growing up in St.Louis, Mo I have attended a lot of public schools and had a lot of different experiences.Some of my experiences were amazing and some of them were not so good.<br>I wanted to sit back and reflect on these experiences because I now have children and its important to think about some of the experiences they may have that will possibly be similar to mine.</p>

      <h2>Elementry School</h2>
  <p>Growing up I went to an elementry school called Larimore. Larimore is located in the Hazelwood school district. It
    was a nice structured school with very nice teachers. Although the teachers were very nice the kids were not always
    the nicest. I descintivley rememeber getting made fun of because my eyebrows connected like Helga G Pataci( <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Arnold!">Visit wikipedia.org</a>.) It was
    not the easiest to deal with, I was so discourged about being made fun for my eyebrows I tried to shave them right
    up the middle. Needless to say I very much so did not do them right at all on top of my mother not being to happy
    about my new profound look. As I look back on this story now I think it is the most hilarious thing because I
    absolutly love how thick my eyebrows are now as an adult. This is a story that I will share with my children because
    I want them to know that they do not have to go to such lengths because other children are not the nicest. I want my
    children to love and cherish everything about their selves and know how awesome they are despite of what others may
    think. <br><img

    <h2>Middle School</h2>
    <p>Middle school was a crazy journey for me because I attened two different middle schools. The first middle
      school I attened was at the time called Kirby middle school, which was a located in the Hazelwood school district.
      The second middle school I attented was called Parkway North East middle, located in the Parkway school district. I
      attented Kirby for my 7th grade year and that was worse than geting made fun of for my eyebrows. The school was
      completley out of control with multiple fights happening every day with so many different kids. It was pretty much a
      school of gladiators.<img

      alt="gladiators in an arena" <em> <br>I hated to
      get up and go to school everyday because I was not looking forward to the unlimited amouts of fights, I mean it was
      litterally every day. I was completely fed up with and so was my mother so when the 7th grade year finished she
      decided to switch schools and send me to Parkway North East middle. When I walked into that building it was nerve
      wrecking simply because I was the new kid but refreshing to be in a completley different invornment. The teachers
      were nice, the students wern't nad and the school was nice compared to what I was used to. I absolutley loved my
      cooking class, and wanted to learn and pay attention. Looking back on how these two different enviornments played a
      part in my academics, mental and physical health I am going to make sure that my kids go to a good public school if
      public school is the route I choose to take. </p>
      <h2>High School</h2>
      
      <p id="testP"class="funParagraph">All four years of high school I attended Parkway North High, which is located in the Parkway school discrict. High
        school for me was nothing like I had imagined from the movies or tv shows I have seen. Not one person there was
        recognized as, "those are the jokes, cheerleaders, geeks etc". I absolutley loved that about my school, I didnt have
        to be labeled, I could just be myself and the social butterfly that I am. I ran track, I did weight lifting, cooking
        , theater, and a lot of other classes. I even took some college courses. I made a lot of friends, life long friends
        at that. There were only like a couple of girls that didn't like me at the time. I look back and think how funny it
        is that the minute things were such a major deal to me and my peers. These minute things now hold no weight in my
        life, I wish I would have known that then. I am going to teach my kids that they should enjoy highschool but also
        take it serious and that every battle is not worth fighting.</p>
